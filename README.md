##Intent/Description
This web site is intended for demonstration purposes ONLY! 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a browser API like the Web Speech API can be used maliciously by an unsuspecting user.
In the current case, the site pretends to be a simple alarm clock web app. 
However, the small clock window that opens is capable of logging every word the user says for an indefinite period of time.
## Browser Support
The Web Speech API is currently only fully implemented in Chrome.
